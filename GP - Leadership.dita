        <p dir="ltr">We understand leadership to be a collective process in which everyone in
            Phoenixâ€™s team participates, assuming direction, execution or achievement roles,
            depending on the situation. All of this lies within the framework of our corporate
            values and responsibilities, both individually and as a team. This leadership permits us
            significant improvements in the processes, products, and services we offer to our
            customers</p>
